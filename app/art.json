        "description": "This is John Rogers' first public art commission. He has since created numerous large-scale public art projects from Alaska to Florida. A Portland native, Rogers studied ceramics at Portland State University, and currently works with diverse materials such as metals, glass, ceramics, stone, cement, plastics, and light. \n\n\"I like to mix qualities found in the organic world with the technical worldﾅ My art relies on a firm understanding of the interplay between art, architecture and engineering. From these disciplines I develop sculptural forms that create a dialogue and tension with the architecturally defined space, as well as the surroundings.\"",

Wegman says he prefers not to think of the dog bowl as public art, stating at the unveiling, \"I did this for dogs, not people.\" An avid dog lover, Wegman donated part of his artist fee to the Oregon Humane Society, Foster Pets and the Delta Society. Wegman is an internationally recognized artist known for his photographic and video collaborations with his dogs. His work has been shown in New York,  Paris, London, Dusseldorf and on Sesame Street.

The piece consists of three large fish made out of colored pavers in the plaza, 69 tiles and mosaics found along retaining walls, and a colorful mural depicting African animals around a watering hole. The tiles came about as a result of the artists working with families at the Matt Dishman Community Center and the mosaics were designed by third and fourth graders from King Elementary School in northeast Portland.  \n\nThe mural by Diakité was repainted in 2012 in an effort to revitalize the plaza. According to Diakité, 'I get much of my inspiration from folktales and stories from my Mother Country of Mali. This mural is inspired by a story that talks about the importance of water as a place where everyone gathers. I wanted to depict an inviting place that welcomed people and nature.'",

Hood as a sign of strength and a hopeful future. The mural integrates these different elements with the architecture of the building and creates a landscape that flows and connects to the next building featuring a second mural by Hector Hernandez, Butterfly Horizon. The subject matter of this neighboring mural is that of hope, and the Urban Wellness mural the blooming of wellness from that hope.",

        "description": "I began this project with a desire to study a group of people who live in a constant state of readiness and observe how that affects them and their environment.  Even in the face of random emergencies, the firefighters exude a cool steadiness, and each knows exactly what to do without hesitation.  I know this must come through years of training and experience,  but to an outsider, it's a marvel how well they work together.  Teamwork, both inside and outside the station, became a prominent theme within many of the paintings.  \n\nOverall, my experience during this residency has been an extremely humbling one.  To witness someone dying can be very humbling, and to see this group save a person's life is even more humbling.  To meet the individuals who are always willing to fight fires and to see them standing on a smoking roof using a chainsaw, causes me to re-evaluate what it means to serve your community.  I was honored to simply sit at their dinner table and hear their stories.  I hope that the artwork will help document, commemorate, and attest to some of the outstanding service of the Portland Firefighters.",

The stones below convey the accumulated weight of actions. Together, they speak to the balance of the weightiness of the courts' activity and the desire for transparency of action. Visible from the exterior, the two present a balance of transparency and obscurity, lightness and weightiness, diffusion and form.",

Extending beyond the immediate community, the mural also displays painted flags representing countries where natural disasters and conflicts have disrupted their people (Japan, Libya, El Salvador).

The artist states that, 'water has a penetrating nature. It can follow and fill any form and space yet it is powerful in its continual strength. Water promises the capacity to change the surrounding environment.' While visitors sit on the artwork, they can be reminded of the rhythm of the waves of water. The carved patterns represent the cycle of waves like the cycle of our human breath, inhaling and exhaling. The artwork as a whole can serve as a reminder of this simple source of life.",

Also, as both art forms are descendant from European traditions, and as the Foster-Powell neighborhood becomes more culturally diverse with many European immigrants, it seeks to embody the essence of the community. The mural with tango dancers' feet on the dance floor and a bandoneun?\"an accordion-like instrument?\"playing tango shows what is happening inside the building. The colors and faux Buenos Aires look will create an enjoyable cultural exchange within the neighborhood by putting the vision out for all to see.",

        "description": "Tread Lightly is a multifaceted installation integrated into the Ed Benedict Skate Plaza which provokes thought regarding the intersection between natural and man made environments, and points towards a search for balance and sustainability. It also aims to create a greater sense of home, and to form a personal connection with the skaters who spend time in the plaza.\n\nTread Lightly consists of four elements. The first two, landMARK1 and landMARK2, give the appearance of being cut out of the concrete slab, lifted up and rotated aside. The iconic nature of the forms makes an instant and memorable mark in the viewer's mind but also begs the question, what do they stand for? The short answer is emblazoned throughout the plaza with the third element, Opposites, a series of contrasting words stamped throughout the skatepark's concrete. The last element, called upRISING, continues the idea of balance by creating a feeling of the earth pushing a rectangular concrete slab up and off of it's back.",

A professor there told me that one problem humans have in addressing environmental problems is our limited ability to perceive at different scales. Many important things are simply too small or too large for us to comprehend. This made me think it would be valuable to reveal some hidden phenomenon, in particular the beautiful single-celled organisms used to evaluate water quality in urban streams.\n\nTwelve oversized diatoms carved in granite are sited in the biofiltration strips unique to the the southern portion of the transit mall. Placing them in the water filtration strips adds a supporting layer of content to the landscape.Unbeknownst to me, the project was recently shown as part of a presentation at the North American Diatom Symposium, delighting the audience of scientists.\n\nWith Urban Hydrology, I tried to thread the needle between beauty, abstraction and content to appeal to both academic and casual viewers.\n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

For the artist, the material and the site presented both opportunities and challenges. In particular, he wanted to create relationships between the multiple pieces while allowing each piece to stand on its own.\n\nFor the concept, Kosuge began by studying the stones, which were relatively small and with curved edges. Their size and shape were central in determining what the final work would look like.\n\nThe resulting five sculptures involve interconnecting visual elements that include repetition, tension and stability. Hopefully, each viewer will have a unique opportunity to enjoy the pieces from different perspectives and to understand the relationship of the sculptural shapes to one another.  \n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

At the center of the sculpture is the Native American trickster 'coyote' representing life that is out of balance. On the back of the coyote is the Grandmother's mask. In many tribal communities, the matriarchs are the doctors who put lives back in balance. Above the Grandmother's mask sits a coastal bird, the Killdeer. This legendary mothering bird distracts predators approaching the nest by acting wounded and hobbling away. Representing the struggles of parenthood, a pair of salmon circle a burden basket. Salmon endure great hardships and eventually give up their own lives to have children. A lamprey eel feeds on the male salmon, showing us the naturally occurring interdependence of species. Peering out of the burden basket is a smiling infant modeled after the artist's daughter, Lily. The sculpture started out expressing the difficult circumstances and troubled life of single parents, often grandparents stepping in to raise a child. But when Bartow placed Lily in the basket it became a hopeful, encouraging and optimistic work (Courtesy of TriMet. For more information visit: http://trimet.org/publicart/greenline/index.htm)",

One form is an abstract shape suggesting a teepee reflected in water. The other more dominant form is that of a thistle, the first plant to pop back up after you've cleared the land.\n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

On certain nights a great white celestial stag is spied in the skies over Portland.\n\nThe piece has two components. There are two sculpture and eight \"story markers\" told as a poem over ten blocks of Old Town and Chinatown. The images in the panels combine the visual language of seventies horror comics and WPA posters. Pedestrians and riders come upon the story in fragments based on their routes through the neighborhood.\n\nThe neighborhood has a layered, rich history.

As I considered ways in which humans mark pathways, I thought of cairns, those man-made stacks of stones that mark hiking trails and which historically have served as landmarks for land and sea navigation, memorials, and commemorative markers. Travelers on cross-country trails traditionally add stones to cairns as they pass, resulting in animated and precarious stacks of rocks and pebbles. This evidence of human comings and goings, these reminders that others have followed the same path signify safety and reassurance out in the wilderness. In the urban wilderness, finding one's way through the various stages of hurry-up-and-wait are just as significant. These stand-alone works speak to the step-by-step marking of time, and incorporate varying degrees of elegance and playfulness. They are related to each other through this thematic underpinning and through the use of stone, but each responds to its site in its own way.\n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

The sculpture echoes an ecological approach to the built environment wherein manufacturing is interwoven with our shared natural resources.\n\nAlthough the Big Pipe Project is the largest infrastructure project in Portland history, it is largely invisible.  Working closely with the Bureau of Environmental Services, the sculpture celebrates this hidden work by revealing and readapting massive precast concrete segments of the Big Pipe.  These pieces of infrastructure are now put to work in support of art and narrative.  Partially buried in the alluvial bank, the sculpture traces out the circumference of the hidden pipe and transforms it from an industrial artifact into a woven arch of currents and eddies.",

I love the way they relate to the Pacific Northwest culture as well as the universal Tiki culture, which extends from the South Pacific through the Northwest and up to Alaska.

The imagery for these paintings evolved out of those conversations.  The  budding white rose is the central focus of the painting, to be viewed as both an object of radiant beauty and a symbol of potential growth.

Independent of the detail carving that appears in its interior base blocks, each sculpture is identical in form and placement, in response to the festival streets' formal layouts. The structures can also be thought of as symbolic shelters housing their respective detail carvings.\n\nSome of the individual details are carved to suggest that artifacts are embedded within the granite base blocks and plinths. Drawn from extensive research, the content of the detail carvings symbolize one or more of the following subjects: a people of common cultural identity, a place in time, historic uses of nearby structures. For example, the southern sculpture on the 3rd and Davis plinth recalls artifacts from Japantown which stood on that location until the \"relocation\" of Japanese-Americans in 1942, while the north sculpture on 3rd and Flanders pays homage to the building of Portland's rail systems, historic and contemporary. Placed within the context of the \"lantern,\" each of these artifact carvings can be seen conceptually as a source of \"light\" which radiates energy into the community.",

Even in the face of random emergencies, the firefighters exude a cool steadiness, and each knows exactly what to do without hesitation.  I know this must come through years of training and experience,  but to an outsider, it's a marvel how well they work together.  Teamwork, both inside and outside the station, became a prominent theme within many of the paintings.  \n\nOverall, my experience during this residency has been an extremely humbling one.  To witness someone dying can be very humbling, and to see this group save a person's life is even more humbling.

As part of the residency I intensely studied every aspect of the five stations life.  This included going on ride along days to observe their work and the communities they serve.  I also researched the history of firefighting in Portland.  All of these observations combined into ceramic wall pieces that celebrate the life of each fire station.\n\nIn 2004, four Portland artists were selected for assignments at five to six fire stations  where they spent time with the crews and went on ride alongs to fire and other emergency calls over the course of one year.  This project was part of intersections, a public art residency program, that explores the convergence of the \"art of work\" and the \"work of art\" by having artists work directly with city or county resources, staff and clients.",

They formed the Oregon Holocaust Memorial Coalition to guide the project with the mission to \"dedicate themselves to immortalizing in stone not only the past history of genocide, but to teach current and future generations that we each have a responsibility to recognize and then help eradicate the hatred and bigotry surrounding us daily.\" \n\nThe work was designed to resemble a European town square, littered with the remnants of a family forced to flee home. From the town square a walkway leads to a large wall featuring the memories of holocaust survivors living in Oregon and the names of relatives lost to Oregonians. The piece terminates with a pillar placed on soil brought in from the six main concentration camps. The design is meant to mirror the journey of holocaust victims and survivors. The site for the memorial was donated by the City of Portland and the memorial was dedicated on August 29. 2004.",

        "description": "The diversity of the community served by the East Portland fire stations truly amazed me.  From the multitude of elder care facilities to the diverse ethnicity of clients, the 9-1-1 calls serve as windows into the rich culture of our city.  Each time the firefighters go on an emergency call, they treat the clients with respect and compassion.  An important support system for this station are the neighborhood associations that it serves.  They rallied fiercely to keep this station open when it was threatened with closure, and a sign honoring that support  is located in front of the station.\n\nIn 2004, four Portland artists were selected for assignments at five to six fire stations  where they spent time with the crews and went on ride alongs to fire and other emergency calls over the course of one year. This project was part of intersections, a public art residency program, that explores the convergence of the \"art of work\" and the \"work of art\" by having artists work directly with city or county resources, staff and clients.",

Even in the face of random emergencies, the firefighters exude a cool steadiness, and each knows exactly what to do without hesitation.  I know this must come through years of training and experience,  but to an outsider, it's a marvel how well they work together.  Teamwork, both inside and outside the station, became a prominent theme within many of the paintings.  \n\nOverall, my experience during this residency has been an extremely humbling one.  To witness someone dying can be very humbling, and to see this group save a person's life is even more humbling.  To meet the individuals who are always willing to fight fires and to see them standing on a smoking roof using a chainsaw, causes me to re-evaluate what it means to serve your community.  I was honored to simply sit at their dinner table and hear their stories.  I hope that the artwork will help document, commemorate, and attest to some of the outstanding service of the Portland Firefighters.",

Within clear view of the sculpture site are the port facilities which exist both along the banks of both the Willamette and Columbia Rivers.  Still existing today are many artifacts of marine architecture both old and new, most of which are made from large diameter logs driven into the river bottom and sometimes lashed together with cables.  Cast in rammed earth molds, the Wapato sculpture makes a somewhat ironic connection between the indigenous marine structures held up by the river bottom and the Wapato site which is made out of river bottom.  Specifically, the Wapato sculpture refers to \"dolphins\" used to mark obstructions and provide mooring facilities for boats, and form of  a boat \"in ruin\" which creates a kind of enclosure surrounded by the orchard trees.  The orchard has obvious references to a significant industry in the State of Oregon; but also provides the further conceptual twist of having real trees intertwining themselves with the concrete trees.",

He seemed interested in everything? an architectural detail, an old tree, a geological formation, a historical monument, an unusual shop or restaurant. Features otherwise hidden to me would be revealed and made significant while spending time with him.\n\nOver the past eight years I have worked on projects exploring the dynamics of social spaces, communities, and environments. These projects have taken the form of installations, publications, educational activities, and public art pieces and have involved a variety of populations: middle school students in Oakland, office workers from the City of Richmond, local residents from the Sunset District in San Francisco, students living in dorms at the University of Washington, shoppers at a mall in Pleasanton, urban gardeners in the Mission District of San Francisco, among others.\n\nMy project for the Streetcar Alignment brings together my early memories of walks with my father, photography, and my involvement with community based art projects. To do this I will install a series of solar powered lights on motion sensors to literally highlight aspects of the neighborhoods that the streetcar will be running through. The units would be attached to pre-existing street car poles and operate from dusk to late evening. It's evident that these neighborhoods already have cultural and aesthetic qualities that define them.  \n\nThe idea draws strictly on what the various neighborhoods along the alignment already have? unusual architecture, old signs, specific trees, old fire hydrants and infrastructure, etc. I will choose several locations to just light a circular spot on the sidewalk that a person could walk into and for a moment stand out for their own visual or gestural significance. In a way, the lights would act as real time photographs of interesting aspects in Portland's nighttime urban environment.",

        "description": "The idea for 'Portlandia', a classical allegorical figure representing the spirit of Portland, came from the official Portland City Seal.  The seal depicts a wilderness scene including mountains, forest, and the sea with Lady Commerce in the foreground holding a trident in her right hand. Together, these figures symbolize the origins of the city, its culture, agrarian base, and industry.  Michael Graves, the architect for the Portland Building, suggested a statue of Lady Commerce as part of his design for the building.  Raymond J. Kaskey, a Washington, D.C. sculptor, won the commission through the City's Percent for Art program.  The sculpture is made of hammered copper sheeting about the thickness of a dime formed around a steel armature, and took three years to complete. She is 1/3 the size of the Statue of Liberty, the only larger statue of this kind in the nation. Portlandia was shipped across the country by rail in eight pieces. After being assembled in a local shipyard, she rode by river barge and truck to her final destination, welcomed by thousands of Portland residents along the riverbank, streets, and bridges.  Her dedication to the citizens of Portland on October 8, 1985, confirmed her acceptance as a new symbol of the city. © Raymond Kaskey. Questions concerning the use of the 'Portlandia' image should be directed to the Regional Arts \u0026 Culture Council at 503.823.5111.",

Since early in his career, when he decided to do what he knew best, his paintings have included Portland imagery.\n\nA large mural of colored woodcut panels entitled A Portland Story was installed on the third floor of City Hall as part of the City's Percent for Art program.  McLarty sees the Willamette River as the heart of the City and made it the central focus of the piece.  The side panels represent incidents, people, and buildings important throughout Portland's history.",

These collages are all made from cut and reassembled signs.  They seem recognizable at first, yet lose all information upon viewing.  I am interested in the new communication that is formed in their familiar but unreadable symbols. \n\nComposition and craftsmanship are two characteristics in artwork that I admire.  I feel that my education, first as a jeweler and later as a fiber artist, not only taught me the respect necessary for this current method of working, but was also instrumental in directing my aesthetic decisions.\"",

I made a progression using local basalt stone and the existing wrecked concrete.\n\nAt the top of the berm there is a grouping of saw-cut vertical basalt, and some irregular, displaced foundations.  As the basalt pieces progress from berm to river, they tip over, so that the concrete below becomes exposed and the basalt becomes submerged and eventually disappears.\n\nAt the river path there are various configurations of concrete and stone, including inlays and pieces that can function as seating.  Concrete is cut in various places to expose the river rock aggregate inside as well as the old embedded wood piers, and some heavy steel reinforcement emerges in various plant-like and root-like ways.\n\nThe work is meant to be a quiet narrative that is derived and retained from the site, rather than a thing that was brought in.",

The design was influenced by William Morris' textile designs from the English Arts and Crafts Movement to complement the architecture of the Central Library. While designed in a modified Georgian Revival Style, the library was built during the same time the Arts and Crafts Movement was occurring and has many Arts and Crafts details within. The artist had the unique challenge of creating a piece of art that would meet the practical need for a new skid-proof staircase while staying true to the conceptual vocabulary of the original structure. Kirkland met the challenge well by sandblasting the design motif into black granite to create a staircase that is beautiful, practical, and timeless.",

The painting is about the human race and is a visual journey in education and awareness.

        "description": "I investigate the small stuff: the twirling samara, the leaf skeleton, the emerging fiddlehead.  In my studio, there are all sorts of seeds, leaves and plant stems floating around.\n\nIn creating pieces for the Midland Library, I designed cast stone medallions for the north and south walls of the buildings exterior.   I wished to link the library to the small park next to it.  I wanted the work to be bold shapes that could be viewed as one walked by, but also could be understood from a distance.\n\nI began thinking of different shapes; an x, a spiral, a diagonal ellipse.  At the same time, I was gathering leaves.  I started making many small models in clay.  Eventually I chose to sculpt native northwest leaves: rhododendron, fern, dogwood, maple and alder.  After I selected these five forms I created more specific models.  At the time, I was learning to paint egg tempera, so I made studies using this technique.\n\nA wooden box \"frame\" was constructed; this would be the size and shape of the final piece and would house the modeled clay leaf.  As a piece was shaped, I would periodically move it outdoors and orient it toward the South, so I could get a sense of shadow at different times of the day. \n\nFrom the wood and clay model, a rubber mold was mad.  These were then transported out to the casting company, where they were filled with a cast stone mix which had been specified by the architect.  The pieces were bundled and trucked to this site.  The medallions were paired in different combinations and installed by some very strong brick masons.",

One is the ring of stone and water tied in an everlasting balance of nature (rivers and mountains, oceans and continents).  The other concept is about us as humans and our expressive aspirations for \"heaven\" represented by the image of a wing - an age-old icon that reappears in many cultures, describing our aspiration for greatness, fantasy and the supernatural.  It is about the heroic feathers that we strive to have and that drive us further in life, about our aspirations that rise like the tower of Babylon, and about the actual gravity and balance of the earth that keeps us intact.",

The sculpture was commissioned after Roosevelt's death as a memorial to what he had come to symbolize to an America that was emerging from its wild past as a world power. At the outbreak of the Spanish American War in 1898, Roosevelt recruited men, many of whom were former college athletes and Western cowboys, to join a cavalry regiment. They were called The Rough Riders. They fought against the Spanish in Cuba, winning fame for their charge up San Juan Hill. \n\nProctor is a celebrated American sculptor known for his sculptures of cowboys and animals of the American West, subject matter that during his lifetime was romanticized in Europe and in high-demand. Proctor grew up in Colorado and was as passionate about hunting as he was about art. Like Dr. Henry Waldo Coe, he also was a hunting partner of Roosevelt's. Proctor took great care in accurately depicting Roosevelt as a symbol of American determination, success, and strength and as a bridge back to the Wild West. Cast in Brooklyn NY, apropos to the part Roosevelt had in the acquirement and development of the Panama Canal, the sculpture was shipped on this route by sea rather than by land to avoid cutting the sculpture into sections to come by rail. Vice President Coolidge was present at the sculpture's groundbreaking.",

'Now is the Time, the Time is Now' is about education, the importance of history, the identity of the African American community and knowledge of where they came from. \nThe mural was created with a second companion mural on the south side of the building designed by Shamsud-Din and painted by the artists Paul Odighizuwa, Charlotte Lewis, and Kathy Pennington. Regrettably this second mural was destroyed in fall 2009 due to necessary repair of the building.",

Portland is pleased to be one on those communities.\n\nThe process of settling into a new culture has influenced Hmong textiles. Consumer demand has altered some of the designs and color patterns of their work, although records suggest that this piece holds to a more historical tradition.",

The sculpture is composed of nearly 500 pieces of specially treated dichroic glass suspended in a 30' sky dome 70 feet above the floor. Carpenter describes designing the piece as \"what appears to be a time-lapse photograph of stars in the sky as they spiral around.\" The colors in the dome change with the time of day and one's viewing angle. In the daytime the sculpture creates ambient light in the rotunda and at night it can be both uplit and backlit to create a reflective surface that both mimics the stars, while also reflecting the activity of the space itself. James Carpenter is an internationally recognized artist who has exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum",

        "description": "Totem Pole was carved by Chief Lelooska of Ariel Washington from red cedar harvested from the base of Mt. Adams. This totem pole is one of the most massive in existence measuring fifty feet high and four feet wide. The carved figures depict a beaver surmounted by a grizzly bear next to a raven topped by four watchmen. The totem was carved during Oregon's Centennial in 1959, to celebrate the state's role in Operation Deep Freeze, which established a scientific station at the geographic South Pole.\n\nBorn Cherokee, Lelooska (1933-1996) was adopted into the Kwakwaka'wakw, and was known for his mastery of storytelling and carving. As a scholar and educator, Lelooska was an authority on the Indians of North America with a particular emphasis on the tribes of the Northwest coastal region. He was known for his versatility in wood sculpting, creating artwork that ranged in size from hand-held rattles and feast bowls to large-scale totem poles. This piece serves as an excellent example of Lelooska's work and is a prized part of Portland's public art collection.",

Born in Everett, Washington in 1919, Mason earned his MFA from the University of Washington in 1947. He taught painting at the University of Washington from 1949 to 1981. Throughout his career, Mason has used a variety of mediums from oil to acrylic. After becoming sensitive to the toxicity of his materials, he then moved to watercolor and oil stick. \n\nAlthough the imagery and media used by Mason have gone through many changes over the years, his paintings always exhibit exuberance and inventiveness in form, color, and style. Mason draws inspiration from Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, and the many different cultures he has encountered while traveling.",

The mural is a culmination of nearly twenty years of historical research and constitutes a powerful tribute to the generations of courageous people who rose from slavery, endured the hardships of the westward journey, and contributed importantly to the settling of the West. The word \"Bilalian,\" used in the title, is synonymous for \"African American\" and has connotations of courage and strong faith associated with Bilal, the first minister of Islam. The word Odyssey, derived from Homer's poem, suggests virtue and perseverance on an epic scale.\n\nAs an African American youth growing up in Portland in the '50s and as an art student at Portland State University in the early '60s, Isaac Shamsud-Din had been frustrated by the lack of information available to him about his cultural heritage. Following his experiences in 1965 as a civil rights activist in Stuttgart, Arkansas, he determined to redress the situation by devoting his life and his art to the preservation and promotion of African American culture. Shamsud-Din is a recognized cultural leader and one of the leading artists in the Northwest.",

I was especially happy when this painting was placed in the Civic Auditorium, where a younger audience could be exposed to my work.  I'm always excited when young people see my work.\"\n\nGrenon, who moved to Portland in the 1970's, considers his most valuable artistic learning experience to be his time spent as a printmaking apprentice at Landfall Press in Chicago.

        "description": "Many critics consider the painter Carl Morris to be one of Oregon's most historically important abstract expressionists. With a background in figurative painting, he pursued the exploration of mood, thought, and feeling through abstract works. His abstract paintings were generally based on nature, poetry, scenery, and his never ending curiosity.  Among his many accomplishments, he and his wife, Hilda Morris, received the prestigious Governor's Art Award in Oregon in 1985.\n\nAbstract Expressionism often describes a general attitude rather than a set of concrete facts and artists working in this style generally place great value on spontaneous improvisation and individuality.  Their work may appear to have been created by accident or chance, but it is always thoughtful and can even be highly planned.",

He taught sculpture at Lewis and Clark for 34 years where he was the head of the department.",

At the time the pieces were installed, Vern Luce lived near Lower MacLeay Park and selected the site both for its visual beauty and its proximity to his home.",
